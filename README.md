## Project Description and Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The main focus of this project is on **wrangling step** of Data Analysis process. Data from different sources of a twitter account should be first gathered. After gathering, the next phase is to assess the data and prepare a To-Do-List for cleaning phase which is coming next. In the last step of wrangling process data was cleaned. In cleaning phase both quality issues and tidiness issues has been addressed.

Eventually, the final clean data have been assessed and visualized briefly.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
As one of the main objective of this project was to practice gathering data, several input files in different formats were considered as input data (data were coming in .cvs, .txt, and .tsv formats)

Coding of this project have been done in two notebooks:
* wrangle_act.ipynb
* act_report.ipynb

## Results <a name="results"></a>

At the end of cleaning phase (after completion of wrangling) a quick comparison have been made between original (before cleaning) and final (after cleaning) data and it was observed that the data was differed SIGNIFICANTLY.
